### Project Manager
This app is called Project Manager. A user can create a project and then add entries to that project and keep track of them with date and time. Users can search the site for any project or entries they've created. Users can Finish (delete) entries when completed. They can also Complete (delete) projects when they're completed, but only if there are no entries associated with that project. There will be a Reports page soon.
